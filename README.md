GipAN
=====

A simple API generator for turning a set of DataMapper resources into a Sinatra application.

WARNING
-------

GipAN is currently in a pre-release state, Semantic Versioning will **not** be
used until the v1.0 release. There may even be major changes with no version
bump.

The example given below *should* represent a mostly stable external API, since
everything is derived from the DataMapper resources the basics are unlikely to
change.  As new features are added examples will be added once their external
API is likely stable.
